# v1.0.2 - Sun Dec 29 22:24:37 SAST 2019
Additions
1. Added ds_str_chsubst() functions for substituting characters in a string.
2. Added ds_str_strsubst() functions for substituting substrings in a string.
3. Added ds_str_trim() functions for removing leading and trailing whitespace.
4. Changed the ds_array implementation to address inefficiencies in the length
   storage.  The interface remains unchanged.

Bugfixes
1. ds_hmap_keys() now returns zero on error.
2. Changed the build system to use the one with the pretty colors. As a bonus
   there is now a build.config file to edit if things need to ever be changed.
